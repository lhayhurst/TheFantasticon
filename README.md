# TheFantasticon
This repo is a taxonomy of fantastic creatures used in role playing games such as Dungeons and Dragons. It is organized as nested directories. 

An example usage of this taxomomy would be to organize portraits and tokens for use in virtual tabletop programs such as [foundry](https://foundryvtt.com/) and [roll20](https://roll20.net/).

The basis of this taxonmy is originally D&D 3.0/3.5, then adjusted for Pathfinder 1.0/2.0 and D&D 5.0.

# TODOS
* Populate each directory with a markdown file containing information about that level of the taxonomy.
* Write an automated build script that visualizes the taxonomy.
